# My little Universe
A place to gather my thoughts. In a form that corresponds to my hobby.
## About me
A hobby administrator who just wants to keep learning little things. And has been moving in the world of Linux derivatives as a hobby for a quarter of a century. 
## Why github
A place to collect my notes and code snippets and easily refer back to them.
